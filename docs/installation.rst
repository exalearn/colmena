Installation
============

Colmena is available via PyPi and you can install it via Pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install colmena

Some of the features require Redis to facilitate communication between different parts of an application.
Wwe recommend Anaconda or your system's package manager to install it.

-----------------------

We recommend installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux in order to use Colmena from a Windows system.
