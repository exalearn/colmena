class ResourceCounter:
    """Utility class for keeping track of resources available for different tasks.

    The class manages two pieces of state: the amount of resources allocated to a certain task,
    and the amount of resources that are currently available for that task.
    Users of this class can change either state using a series of thread-safe methods.

    *Tracking Allocations*: The resource counter is initialized with a certain count of resources,
    which represent the total number of a certain computing device available (e.g., node, GPU).
    They all begin as "unallocated" for any task.

    Users change the amount of resources dedicated to tasks by "reallocating" them from one task to another.
    The :meth:`reallocate` method achieves this by requesting a certain number of units from one task
    and adding them to a second task's available resources once those units are marked as available.

    *Tracking Utilization*: The amount of resources in use for a certain task is tracked by an internal counter.
    Users of this class request the use a certain number of resources by calling the :meth:`acquire` method.
    The method blocks until either the request is completely fulfilled (i.e., the specified amount of resources
    are marked as available) or the operation times out.

    Resources are marked as available again using the :meth:`release` method.
    The release method marks those resources as available to be re-used for other tasks of the same type.
    Resources must be re-allocated using :meth:`reallocate`.

    **Implementation**: All of the operations described above are thread-safe.
    Resource utilization is tracked using a semaphore so that threads can acquire and release resources simultaneously.
    Resources are acquired as first-come-first-served by using a lock to control access to the "acquire" function
    of the resource utilization semaphore.
