    Proxy objects are not JSON serializable so this function, when passed to
    `json.dumps()`, will attempt to JSON serialize the wrapped object. If the
    proxy is not resolved, a warning will be raised for the user and the
    proxy will be replaced with a placeholder string for the proxy. This
    1) prevents JSON serialization from failing and 2) avoid unintended
    resolutions of proxies that may invoke expensive communication operations
    without the user being aware.

    Usage:
        >>> # With JSON dump/dumps
        >>> json.dumps(json_obj_containing_proxy, default=proxy_json_encoder)
        >>> # With Pydantic
